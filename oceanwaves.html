                <p class="blog-text">In late 2023, I began working on a personal game project based around traversing
                    the ocean. Since the ocean simulation was a main focus of the game, it needed to be both
                    flexible enough to dynamically control the ocean state and detailed enough to represent a wide
                    variety of weather conditions - all while running in real-time. Although I
                    never finished the rest of the game, I consider the ocean simulation itself to be my proudest
                    achievement as a programmer.</p>

                <p class="blog-text">Initially, I tried using a few layered Gerstner waves (waves with both vertical and
                    horizontal displacement) to simulate the ocean, but the results were lackluster. The combined result
                    was not very detailed, and since I was simulating the waves on the CPU, I could only add so many
                    waves before performance started to degrade.

                <p class="blog-text">Luckily, I came across two videos by <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/yPfagLeUa7k">Acerola</a> and
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/kGEqaX4Y4bQ">Jump Trajectory</a> which describe a technique based on the
                    fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm that can simulate many thousands of waves in parallel on the
                    GPU. There's a good amount of math involved, but basically, we take advantage of the
                    inverse Fourier transform's ability to convert a set of wave frequencies into actual waves.
                    This means that if we can find out the overall distribution of wave frequencies in the ocean,
                    we can convert that into an accurate representation of the ocean. Lucky again, there are already
                    formulas available that can give us an oceanographic spectrum from a set of parameters like wind
                    speed, wind direction, ocean depth, etc.

                <p class="blog-text">I used the JONSWAP ocean wave spectrum function and a Cosine-2s directional
                    spreading function to generate the frequency domain representation of the initial ocean state. The
                    result is a texture where wave frequency is represented as the distance from the center, wave
                    direction is the direction from the center, and a complex amplitude is stored in the red and green
                    channels of each pixel. The red and green channels are also multiplied by random gaussian
                    distributed noise to create a natural distribution of wave phase and amplitude. There's another
                    step that involves generating an additional complex conjugate version of the frequency spectrum, but
                    I won't get too much into that.</p>

                    around the complex plane. The resulting Fourier components texture can be run through an inverse FFT
                    (IFFT) to become the heightmap of the ocean at the specified time, but before we do that, we can
                    derive additional Fourier components textures for the horizontal displacements of the Gerstner waves
                    and for the slope on each axis (for normal mapping) using a few complex multiplications.</p>

                    as fragment normals. I implemented the inverse FFT using a compute shader version of the
                    Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm as described by Fynn-Jorin Fl√ºgge in his <a

                    pre-computing a "butterfly texture" that contains the "twiddle factors" for each stage of the divide
                    and conquer algorithm. The butterfly texture is then used in another compute shader for the
                    horizontal
                    and vertical IFFT pass on the fourier components textures.

                    around how the entire thing works; I honestly consider it to be as close as you can get to real
                    magic because the result of the IFFT is a highly detailed displacement and slope map of the ocean
                    that animates realistically and tiles seamlessly. Profiling it on my machine, the compute shaders
                    take about 5ms total each frame, and I know with my sloppy implementation there's surely room to
                    optimize
                    it further.

                <p class="blog-text">There is still one glaring issue with this solution: tiling.
                    I haven't mentioned that I'm using the anti-tiling technique described in the
                    Acerola and Jump Trajectory videos where we split the frequncy domain into multiple cascades for the
                    low, medium, and high frequency waves. The inverse FFT is performed for each of the frequency
                    cascades so that we can layer each displacement map on top of each other at different scales. The
                    effect of this is that the large waves tile over much a larger area, and the smaller waves that tile
                    more frequently are layered on top. Even with three cascades, the effect of tiling is almost
                    eliminated while the fine details are preserved, and since the FFT is so fast, we can afford to
                    triple
                    the number of FFTs computed each frame.
